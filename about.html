    <p class="about">  Born in Prien am Chiemsee, Germany I grew up  in a family of musicians, I was always surrounded by the arts, though not specifically the visual arts. I attended a Waldorf school, where creativity and artistic expression play a significant role, so I was introduced to painting at an early age. However, it wasn’t until I moved to Graz—where I’m currently based—that I truly discovered my passion for painting and drawing.</p>
    <p class="about2">In today’s world, it’s easy to lose sight of the beauty and joy life has to offer. Through my art, I aim to gently remind people of those fleeting, beautiful moments—whether it's a serene landscape, an abstract form, or a simple composition that stirs emotion. My hope is to create small windows of escape, inviting viewers to pause, breathe, and find a moment of joy in what they see.</p>
